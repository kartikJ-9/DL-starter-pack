This section contains the face recognition module that is implemented using OpenCV.

OpenCV has Haar Cascade for detection. Cascade Classifiers are pre-defined as XML files.
MultiStage Function is capable of detecting faces.

Performance : 
Haar Cascade gives fast,seamless real-time in video streaming recognition systems. The Accuracy of Haar Cascades, however, could be improved using Deep Learning Techniques.
Haar Cascade uses Adaboost for selecting optimal features with minimal error rate.
